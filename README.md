# QLab_Applescripts

A collection of text files to be copied into the script editor.

Github goes wonky with applescripts. You can download the raw file and run
it in the editor, but you can't view it on Github. To allow readability I've
uploaded everything as .txt files so their contents will display and to guarantee
version tracking. The text of these files can be copied and pasted directly
into the script source of a script cue.

## Basic Navigation

This repo is broken up by how I sort these scripts in cue lists in my personal
QLab 4 template. I built this template around a specific venue so there may be some
unusual quirks(audio routing for one can be a little strange).

### Fades

These are my most used hotkeys. Includes fade in/out, create non/looping
audio playlist, create non/looping video playlist, create non/looping
image slideshow. Needs: Create random playlist.

### Audio Levels

Very handy for theatrical sound design. Includes reset crosspoints stereo,
isolate crosspoints, set absolute level(master), set relative level(master)
large/small bump, large/small dip.

### Other

Some frequently used miscellany. Includes create Eos Go OSC, create soundcheck
from selected, createre cue list in Numbers, move cue to cut list, set color
by type, set color of selected.

### Batch Edit

This scripts primarily written before and are mostly unnecessary now. But
they represent some great coding so I don't delete them, and often borrow
snippets.

### Logging

These scripts are a logging generator to make tracker cues to insert into
your showfile, based on the Captain Slog chapter of the Qlab Cookbook.

### Projector

A few shortcuts for working with Projector Manager.

### Misc

These are scripts that I don't use often, have newer versions of, or just
don't want to delet, there's a little but of everything in here.

Most of these scripts have been lightly edited by me to for my use cases,
but are not my creations. A sinificant debt of gratitude is owed to Rich
Walsh of allthatyouhear.com and Mic Pool of qlabcookbook.com. Additionally,
the many contributors to Figure 53's scripts and macros page will find
variations on their work here. I've tried to keep attribution where I know
the source, and apologize if there is anything mislabeled inside.
