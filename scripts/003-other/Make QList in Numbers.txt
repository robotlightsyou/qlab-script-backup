--Shift+Ctrl+Q Make QList in Numbers(*
Tested with QLab v3.2.14 Oct 2018
Please report any issues to robotlightsyou@gmail.com with subject "QLAB 3 template issues"

NEEDS:
1. Presently all midi LX cues show a program change of 60 in Numbers, this is inaccurate, midi LX cues do not affect Yamaha LS9 programs.
