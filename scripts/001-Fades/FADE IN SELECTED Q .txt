--Ctrl+F FADE IN SELECTED Q (*
Tested with QLab v3.2.14 Oct 2018
Please report any issues to robotlightsyou@gmail.com with subject "QLAB 3 template issues"

*** Naming may not function correctly if you have not set a name for selected cue in QLab, mostly seen when importing but not renaming audio files though it may occur elsewhere. Fading functionality not affected.
